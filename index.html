            <h1>My Goals from this Course</h1>
            <ol>
                <p>A goal and things that i want to achieve for this course are
                    to be able to get a general idea, of what it means to code, and to know how to fully develop a Webpage from ground zero.
                </p>
                <p> Another one of my goals outside of learning Code and Web Development is to prove to myself that i am able to buckle down and learn something new and challenging as Code, and complete the small milestones that I set along the way.
